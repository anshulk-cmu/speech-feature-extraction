```

### 3. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `speech-feature-extraction` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Implementation of LMF and MFCC feature extraction for speech recognition - CMU 18-781 (Prof. Shinji Watanabe)"
4. Choose **Public** (to share with others) or **Private** (for personal use)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/anshulk-cmu/speech-feature-extraction.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Configure Repository Settings

On GitHub, go to your repository settings:

- Description: "LMF and MFCC feature extraction for speech recognition - CMU 18-781 (Prof. Shinji Watanabe)"
- Website: (optional - your portfolio/LinkedIn)
- Topics: `speech-recognition`, `signal-processing`, `mfcc`, `feature-extraction`, `cmu`, `python`, `audio-processing`, `machine-learning`

#### Optional: Add Repository Features
- [x] Issues (allow bug reports and discussions)
- [x] Projects (if you plan to track improvements)
- [x] Wiki (optional - for extended documentation)

## üé® Recommended Repository Enhancements

### Add a Banner/Logo (Optional)

Create a banner image and add to README.md:
```markdown
![Project Banner](docs/banner.png)
```

### GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` to automatically test on push:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        cd feat_extract
        python feat_extract.py
```

### Add GitHub Pages (Optional)

Host documentation using GitHub Pages:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch `main` ‚Üí `/docs` folder
3. Create `docs/index.html` with project documentation

## üìä Post-Publication Tasks

### 1. Update Your Profile README

Add this project to your GitHub profile README:

```markdown
### üé§ Speech Feature Extraction for ASR
Implemented LMF and MFCC algorithms for speech recognition as part of CMU's 18-781 course.
Includes comprehensive DSP pipeline with visualization tools.

[View Repository ‚Üí](https://github.com/anshulk-cmu/speech-feature-extraction)
```

### 2. Share on LinkedIn

Example post:
```
üéì Excited to share my implementation of speech feature extraction algorithms!

As part of CMU's 18-781 Speech Recognition course (taught by Prof. Shinji Watanabe),
I built a complete pipeline for:
‚Ä¢ Log Mel Filterbank (LMF) features
‚Ä¢ Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
‚Ä¢ Signal processing with FFT and mel-scale filtering

The implementation includes visualization tools and comprehensive documentation covering the mathematical foundations.

Check it out: https://github.com/anshulk-cmu/speech-feature-extraction

#MachineLearning #SignalProcessing #SpeechRecognition #CMU #Python
```

### 3. Add to Your Resume/Portfolio

**Projects Section:**
```
Speech Feature Extraction System | Python, NumPy, SciPy
‚Ä¢ Implemented DSP algorithms for LMF and MFCC feature extraction from audio
‚Ä¢ Built visualization pipeline comparing spectrograms and acoustic features
