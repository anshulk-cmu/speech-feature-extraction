The power spectrogram shows high detail across the entire linear frequency range, with most of the complex harmonic structures concentrated in the lower frequencies. The Log Mel Filterbank (LMF) plot compresses this information by warping the frequency axis to the Mel scale, resulting in a clearer view of speech formants with fewer vertical components compared to the spectrogram. Finally, the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) plot appears the most compact and decorrelated, as the Discrete Cosine Transform has packed the signal's energy into the first few coefficients, effectively smoothing out the harmonic details seen in the LMF plot.
