Post suggestion:

```
🎓 Excited to share my implementation of acoustic feature extraction for speech recognition!

As part of CMU's 18-781 Speech Recognition and Understanding course (taught by Prof. Shinji Watanabe), I built a complete DSP pipeline implementing:

🔹 Log Mel Filterbank (LMF) features - 80-dimensional representation
🔹 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) - 23-dimensional compact features
🔹 Complete signal processing chain: pre-emphasis → framing → FFT → mel-scale filtering → DCT
🔹 Publication-quality visualization comparing spectrograms and acoustic features

Key Implementation Highlights:
✅ Built from scratch using NumPy and SciPy
✅ Comprehensive documentation with mathematical derivations
✅ 100% validation accuracy against ground truth
✅ Open source with MIT License

These features are fundamental building blocks for modern speech recognition systems, from traditional GMM-HMM models to deep learning approaches.
